  `Rick: Morty, Morty, I think we've got ourselves a problem here. I've
been scanning the entire multiverse, and I can't seem to find any
characters. It's like they've vanished into thin air, Morty.`,
  "Morty: Oh, geez, Rick. What do you mean, no characters?",
  "Rick: Well, Morty, it appears we've stumbled upon a glitch in the simulation. Someone must have messed with the code, and now all the characters have gone missing. This is some serious interdimensional malfunction, Morty.",
  "Morty: W-what are we gonna do, Rick? How can we fix this?",
  "Rick: Hold on a second, Morty. I think I have an idea. We're gonna have to dive deep into the coding of this simulation and rewrite the script. We'll bring those characters back, even if it takes us all night, Morty.",
  "Morty: B-but, Rick, I don't know anything about coding!",
  "Rick: Don't worry, Morty. I'll do all the heavy lifting. Just stand there and look confused, like you always do.",
  "Morty: Uh, okay, Rick. If you say so.",
